# NOTE: Oh My Posh secondary prompt (the continuation prompt) is not directly
# translatable to Starship. Starship uses the shell's native continuation prompt.
# If you want to customize it, you'll need to set it in your shell config (zshrc).

# TRANSLATION NOTES:
# 1. Console title: Starship doesn't support setting console/terminal titles.
#    You'd need to set this in your shell config (precmd in zsh).
#
# 2. Secondary prompt: Oh My Posh's secondary_prompt feature (the "→ :" prompt)
#    is not available in Starship. This is typically handled by the shell itself.
#    In zsh, you can set PS2='%F{magenta}→%f : '
#
# 3. The purple "tab" icon (󰫢) before the path: Translated as plain text symbol.
#
# 4. Exact color matching: Oh My Posh uses #8443e3 for the icon, which I've
#    preserved. Other colors (yellow, red, cyan, green) are approximated.
#
# 5. Git status symbols: Starship and Oh My Posh handle these differently.
#    The mapping is approximate but functional.
#
# 6. Spacing: Oh My Posh has specific spacing that may look slightly different
#    in Starship due to how the two tools handle formatting.
